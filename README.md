# Snyk JSON to HTML Mapper

The Snyk JSON to HTML Mapper takes the json outputted from `snyk test --json` and creates a local HTML file displaying the vulnerabilities discovered.

# How do I use it?

## Install or clone

First, Install the Snyk JSON to HTML Mapper using npm:

`npm install snyk-to-html -g`

Alternatively, you can clone the repo and run the script locally using:

```javascript
npm install
npm run build
node ./dist/index.js
```

When in doubt, use `snyk-to-html --help` or `snyk-to-html -h`.

## Generate the HTML report

Snyk JSON to HTML Mapper mapper works with the different Snyk Products.  Change the directory to your package's root folder, then use  one of the  ways below to generate the HTML report, using the appropriate product's command

1. Directly streaming the results to snyk-to-html:

   **For Snyk Open Source**

      Run the following line to create a file called `results-opensource.html`:

      `snyk test --json | snyk-to-html -o results-opensource.html`

   **For Snyk Code**

      Run the following line to create a file called `results-code.html`:

      `snyk code test --json | snyk-to-html -o results-code.html`


   **For Snyk Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
      Navigate to the subfolder with the related files.

      Run the following line to create a file called `results-iac.html`:

      `snyk iac test --json | snyk-to-html -o results-iac.html`


   **For Snyk Container**

    Run the following line to create a file called `results-container.html`:

      `snyk container test [image] --json | snyk-to-html -o results-container.html`

      The following methods/examples will utilize snyk test, however they will also work with the other product commands , as above.

2. Using a temporary file:

   Generate JSON data by running `snyk test` and save the output to a file

   `snyk test --json > results.json`

   Pass the resulting JSON file to Snyk's JSON to HTML Mapper

   `snyk-to-html -i results.json -o results.html`

   Note input files should be valid JSON and use UTF-8 encoding.

3. If you want a simpler version of the report to be shown, you can pass `-s` or `--summary` to only
   display the summary of the report.

   `snyk-to-html -i results.json -o results.html -s`

4. Show actionable remediation:

   To display the actions you can take to remedy vulnerabilities, pass `-a` or `--actionable-remediation`.

   `snyk-to-html -i results.json -o results.html -a`

   The report orders remediations (upgrades and patches) by the number and severity of vulnerabilities it fixes.
   Use this to guide when selecting the order to upgrade and patch packages.

   Note we currently support remediation advice with the following package managers:

   * npm
   * yarn
   * rubygems
   * maven
   * gradle
   * sbt
   * pip

## View the HTML report

Simply open your new file (`results-[type].html` as above) in a browser, and rejoice.
