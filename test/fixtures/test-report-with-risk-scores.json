      "description": "## Overview\n[`ejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs) is a popular JavaScript templating engine.\nAffected versions of the package are vulnerable to _Remote Code Execution_ by letting the attacker under certain conditions control the source folder from which the engine renders include files.\nYou can read more about this vulnerability on the [Snyk blog](https://snyk.io/blog/fixing-ejs-rce-vuln).\n\nThere's also a [Cross-site Scripting](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ejs:20161130) & [Denial of Service](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:ejs:20161130-1) vulnerabilities caused by the same behaviour. \n\n## Details\n`ejs` provides a few different options for you to render a template, two being very similar: `ejs.render()` and `ejs.renderFile()`. The only difference being that `render` expects a string to be used for the template and `renderFile` expects a path to a template file.\n\nBoth functions can be invoked in two ways. The first is calling them with `template`, `data`, and `options`:\n```js\nejs.render(str, data, options);\n\nejs.renderFile(filename, data, options, callback)\n```\nThe second way would be by calling only the `template` and `data`, while `ejs` lets the `options` be passed as part of the `data`:\n```js\nejs.render(str, dataAndOptions);\n\nejs.renderFile(filename, dataAndOptions, callback)\n```\n\nIf used with a variable list supplied by the user (e.g. by reading it from the URI with `qs` or equivalent), an attacker can control `ejs` options. This includes the `root` option, which allows changing the project root for includes with an absolute path.  \n\n```js\nejs.renderFile('my-template', {root:'/bad/root/'}, callback);\n```\n\nBy passing along the root directive in the line above, any includes would now be pulled from `/bad/root` instead of the path intended. This allows the attacker to take control of the root directory for included scripts and divert it to a library under his control, thus leading to remote code execution.\n\nThe [fix](https://github.com/mde/ejs/commit/3d447c5a335844b25faec04b1132dbc721f9c8f6) introduced in version `2.5.3` blacklisted `root` options from options passed via the `data` object.\n\n## Disclosure Timeline\n- November 27th, 2016 - Reported the issue to package owner.\n- November 27th, 2016 - Issue acknowledged by package owner.\n- November 28th, 2016 - Issue fixed and version `2.5.3` released.\n\n## Remediation\nThe vulnerability can be resolved by using the GitHub integration to [generate a pull-request](https://snyk.io/org/projects) from your dashboard or ignored by running `snyk ignore` from the command-line interface.\nOtherwise, Upgrade `ejs` to version `2.5.3` or higher.\n\n## References\n- [Snyk Blog](https://snyk.io/blog/fixing-ejs-rce-vuln)\n- [Fix commit](https://github.com/mde/ejs/commit/3d447c5a335844b25faec04b1132dbc721f9c8f6)\n\n",
